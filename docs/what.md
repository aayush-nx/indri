### Why do we need conversations ? 
We are social animals. Our thoughts become clearer as we discuss them with others. 
We relax when there is someone who listens. We dont always look for purpose in a conversation. 
Even a mundane topic like what is your favorite place can lead to an interesting conversation. 

    1. We trust those we can talk to
    2. Noone likes to type. Its error prone, its not natural. Its hard to express emotions and information gets lost on chat
    3. most people are incapable of handling the complexity of human emotions. They need help in navigating and understanding social situations. 
    4. as digital life becomes more real like, people will talk to both machines and humans
    5. world is becoming more complex everyday with many interdependent systems. people will need help in navigating this world. We work a lot in making everything simple so everyone can use it. Maybe we dont have to anymore

### What is difference between chatgpt and Indri ? 
Chatgpt is designed to help you solve problems. 
Sometimes you don't want solutions, you just need someone to talk to you.

Its personality is of a question answering system. 
Its always helpful but it's not something you can freely talk to. 
It comes off as a know-it-all who believes every problem has a straightforward solution.    
It doesn't undertstand my inhibitions and treats me the same as it treats everyone else.
